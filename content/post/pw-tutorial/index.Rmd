This is a self-contained, practical tutorial on the use of the `WR` package to fit a priority-adjusted
proportional win-fractions (PW) regression model for a composite endpoint consisting
of death and non-fatal events. The model is a regression version of Pocock's
two-sample win ratio (Pocock et al., 2012). The methodology is described in full
detail and generality in Mao and Wang (2020).

## Input data and regression function
The input data for analysis should be arranged in the "long format", with an `ID` vector
containing unique patient-level identifiers. In addition, we need a `time` vector containing the
event times and a `status` vector indicating the corresponding cause of the event. The vector `status` 
should be coded as `1`=death; `2`=non-fatal event; `0`=censoring.
In the case of recurrent non-fatal event, multiple rows with `status`=2 are allowed.
However, by nature of the method, only time to the first episode will be used.
Finally, we need a covariate matrix `Z` with the same row as `ID`.
Each column of `Z` represents a covariate. All covariates need to be time-constant.

The main function to fit the PW model is `pwreg(time,status, Z, ID)` with arguments
in specified formats as above. 
The function returns an object of class `pwreg`
with a `beta` vector for $\widehat{\boldsymbol\beta}$ 
and a `Var` matrix for $\text{var}(\widehat{\boldsymbol\beta})$.
For details, refer to documentation of the `WR` package.


## An example: HF-ACTION study

We consider a dataset from the HF-ACTION study consisting of 451 non-ischemic heart failure patients.
The study was conducted between
April 2003 through Feb 2007 at 82 sites in the USA, Canada, and France (O’Connor et al., 2009). 
The study objective was to assess the effect of adding aerobic exercise training to
usual care on the patient’s CV outcomes. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause
death and all-cause hospitalization. 

We first load the `WR` package and the analysis dataset `non_ischemic`.
```{r setup}
library(WR)
head(non_ischemic)
```
We re-label the covariates with informative names.
```{r}
colnames(non_ischemic)[4:16]=c(
  "Training vs Usual","Age (year)","Male vs Female","Black vs White", 
  "Other vs White", "BMI","LVEF","Hypertension","COPD","Diabetes",
  "ACE Inhibitor","Beta Blocker", "Smoker"
)
```

Compute the sample size the median length of follow-up.
```{r}
# sample size
length(unique(non_ischemic$ID))
# median length of follow-up time
median(non_ischemic$time[non_ischemic$status<2])/30.5
```
So we indeed have $n=451$ unique patients with a median follow-up of 31.6 months.


Next, we use the `pwreg()` function to fit the PW model:
```{r}
# get the number of rows and number of covariates.
nr <- nrow(non_ischemic)
p <- ncol(non_ischemic)-3

# extract ID, time, status and covariates matrix Z from the data.
# note that: ID, time and status should be column vector.
# covariatesZ should be (nr, p) matrix.
ID <- non_ischemic[,"ID"]
time <- non_ischemic[,"time"]
status <- non_ischemic[,"status"]
Z <- as.matrix(non_ischemic[,4:(3+p)],nr,p)


# pass the parameters into the function
pwreg.obj <- pwreg(time=time,status=status,Z=Z,ID=ID)
print(pwreg.obj)
```
The output consists of three parts. The first part presents some descriptive statistics
on the proportions of win-loss status among all ${n\choose 2}=101,475$ pairs.
According to the output, $7.5\%$ of them are determined by death; $77.2\%$
by hospitalization, and the remaining $7.2\%$ are indeterminate.
It also reports an overall (Wald) test with $p$-value 0.024, suggesting that, at the conventional 0.05 level,
the 13 covariates are significantly associated with the composite outcome.


The second part presents a table for the estimates and standard errors of the 
regression coefficient, along with their corresponding $p$-value
for testing the coefficient being zero.
The third part is perhaps the most informative, tabulating the estimated win ratios
(exponential of the regression coefficients) and their
associated $95\%$ confidence intervals. 
We can see that a patient in exercise training is $21\%$ more likely to have a better
priority-adjusted composite outcome than one in usual care.
However, this difference is statistically not significant.
In addition, younger age, white race, higher LVEF are significantly associated with
more favorable outcomes than otherwise, while the beneficial effects of low BMI
and absence of COPD history are border-line significant.


To assess the effect of race on the composite outcome, we test the null hypothesis
\[H_0:\beta_4=\beta_5=0.\]
We  conduct a 2-df Chi-square Wald test based on $(\widehat\beta_4,\widehat\beta_5)^{T}$:
```{r}
#extract estimates of (\beta_4,\beta_5)
beta <- matrix(pwreg.obj$beta[4:5])
#extract estimated covariance matrix for (\beta_4,\beta_5)
Sigma <- pwreg.obj$Var[4:5,4:5]
#compute chisq statistic in quadratic form
chistats <- t(beta) %*% solve(Sigma) %*% beta  

#compare the Wald statistic with the reference
# distribution of chisq(2) to obtain the p-value
1 - pchisq(chistats, df=2)
```
The $p$-value is 0.102. So the overall effect of race on the composite outcome
is non-significant.


Finally, we use the `score.proc()` function to plot the standardized score process for each covariate:

```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width=7}
score.obj <- score.proc(pwreg.obj)
print(score.obj)

 
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
oldpar <- par(mfrow = par("mfrow"))
par(mfrow = c(4,4))
for(i in c(1:13)){
  plot(score.obj, k = i)
}
par(oldpar)
```

Most curves are fairly patternless with suprema well bounded by 2. So we conclude that the proportionality assumption approximately holds.
