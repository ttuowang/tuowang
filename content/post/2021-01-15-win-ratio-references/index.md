## Win Ratio References

Win ratio is a novel approach to analyze prioritized composite endpoints. After proposed by Pocock et al. (2012), it gained much attention in both academic and industry. I summarized some important references regarding win ratio statistics.

### Theory

**Background:**

- [Combining mortality and longitudinal measures in clinical trials.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0258%2819990615%2918%3A11%3C1341%3A%3AAID-SIM129%3E3.0.CO%3B2-7), Finkelstein and Schoenfeld (1999)
