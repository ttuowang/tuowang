The Kaplan-Meier estimator is one of the most popular statistical methods in survival analysis. In this tutorial, I will present how to calculate the confidence interval for the Kaplan-Meier estimator in R.

Let $T$ denote the time to event. Let $C$ denote the time to censoring. Define $S(t) = P(T > t)$ as the survival function. Let $d_j$ and $n_j$ be the number of patients die and at risk at time $t_j$. Then the Kaplan-Meier estimator is

$$
\widehat{S}(t) = \prod_{j:t_j \leq t}(1 - \frac{d_j}{n_j}).
$$

Here I use the *ovarian* data in the R *survival* package as an example.

``` {r}
library(survival)
fit1 <- survfit(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ resid.ds, data=ovarian)
print(fit1)
```
