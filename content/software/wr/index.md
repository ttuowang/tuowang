**Description:**

Implements various win ratio methodologies for composite endpoints of death and nonfatal events, including the (stratified) proportional win-fractions (PW) regression models (Mao and Wang, 2020 <doi:10.1111/biom.13382>), (stratified) two-sample tests with possibly recurrent nonfatal event, and sample size calculation for standard win ratio test (Mao et al., 2021 <doi:10.1111/biom.13501>).
