I summarized the notes about some key topics in Causal Inference. Most of the materials come from STAT 992 in UW-Madison instructed by Prof. Kang and from several textbooks in causal inference.

Here are the [Notes](https://ttuowang.github.io/causal-inference-notes/).

Recommended textbook:

- Paul Rosenbaum. “Design of OBservational Studies” (2010)
- Miguel Hernan & James Robins. “Causal Inference” (2019)
- Guido Imbens and Don Rubin. “Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences” (2015)
