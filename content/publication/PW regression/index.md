abstract = "The win ratio is gaining traction as a simple and intuitive approach to analysis of prioritized composite endpoints in clinical trials. To extend it from two-sample comparison to regression, we propose a novel class of semi- parametric models that includes as special cases both the two-sample win ratio and the traditional Cox proportional hazards model on time to the first event. Under the assumption that the covariate-specific win and loss fractions are proportional over time, the regression parameter can be interpreted as the log win ratio associated with one-unit increase in the covariate and is unrelated to the censoring distribution. A class of U-statistic estimating functions, in the form of an arbitrary covariate-specific weight process integrated by a pairwise residual process, is constructed to obtain consistent estimators for the regression parameter. The asymptotic properties of the estimators are derived using uniform weak convergence theory for U-processes. Visual inspection of a “score” process provides useful clues as to the plausibility of the proportionality assumption. Extensive numerical studies using both simulated and real data from a major cardiovascular trial show that the multiple regression methods provide valid inference on covariate effects and outperform the two-sample win ratio in both efficiency and robustness. The proposed methodology is implemented in the R-package WR publicly available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)."
