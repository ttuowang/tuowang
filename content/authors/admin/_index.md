I am a third year PhD student in biomedical data science in the department of [Biostatistics & Medical Informatics at UW-Madison](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/). My advisor is [Prof. Lu Mao](https://sites.google.com/view/lmaowisc/home). I also work as a biostatistician at [Data Coordinating Center](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/research/clinical-trials/data-coordinating-center/).

Before coming to UW-Madson, I received my bachelor degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University, and my master degree in applied statistics from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. When I was in Umich, I worked in [Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR)](http://www.socr.umich.edu/) team supervised by Prof. Ivo Dinvo.

My research focuses on causal inference, clinical trials and statistical methods for composite endpoints. I'm also enthusiastic about data science and data visualization in R.
